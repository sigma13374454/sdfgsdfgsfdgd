alr so here are the intructions: Put all of these files into a usb and then change the boot sequence in bios so that it boots into the usb first and then the os, After that click enter when it says smth like esc to ignore startup.nsh and after it boots to the os, ur serials should be changed, for the disk spoofing part basically just drag the .sys to the kdmapper and lastly for mac spoofing just run mac.exe as admin, if ur internet goes away for a few seconds its fine.
This is just basic amideefi so ion think its gona unban but i havent tested it, maybe someone who isnt a skid can find an efi spoofing method using bootmgfw.efi
